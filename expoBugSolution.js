The solution involves thoroughly checking the Expo SDK documentation for compatibility.  If a feature is unsupported, consider using an alternative approach that achieves the same functionality.  Often a workaround exists, or you may need to wait for future Expo SDK updates. Here's how to check and adapt the code:

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js

import * as Expo from 'expo'; // Assuming the bug was related to an Expo feature

// Check for feature support before using it
if (Expo.isSupportedFeature('theFeature')) {
  // Use the feature safely
  Expo.useTheFeature();
} else {
  // Use a fallback mechanism
  console.log('Feature not supported, using fallback.');
  // Implement a substitute solution here
}
```
